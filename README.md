Writing my third app! 
- Written in Python3 
- Tkinter Module for GUI development 
- Time taken to build verson 1.0: 2 days 
- Requires installation of following modules: pycryptography, sqlalchemy, pillow
- Encrypted passwords stored on SQLite database.

# Initial authentication screen:

- Uses SHA256 hashing algorithm for authenication and key for password encryption.

# What I learnt from this project: 
- Fundamental value of unicode, along with the .encode() and decode() functions
- How to write encryption functions using methods from the pycryptography module 
- How to build treeviews using TKinter GUI tools 

# Future Tasks: 
- Improve GUI interface 
- Allow user to set their own password hash through the initial screen.
